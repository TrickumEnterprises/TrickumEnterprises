- 👋 Hi, I’m Benny Trickum, Cheif Excecutive Officer of Trickum Enterprises LLC 
- 👀 We at Trickum Enterprises are interested and absolutely committed too making a lasting mark on the world.
- 🌱 I’m a Entrepreneur of the highest standard.  I let nothing stand in my way or hold be back.  Lack of information is only a set back in achieving a deadline, never a road block or even worth stumbling over.  Information is just a button away so get that shit, get all you can get!
- 💞️ I’m mostly here for documentation and exposure.  There is nothing I've set my mind to that I haven't achieved or been successful at, (except my marrage, and I do consider that a lose even though there was nothing I could really do in that).  I am also open to collaborating with others to brainstorm anything and everything to make life more efficient for the generations after us.
- 📫 Please feel free to mail me with any questions, ideas, comments, or (any ladies that  wanna chat-💞️-please feel free...wooof! lol) admin@trickumenterprise.com.
