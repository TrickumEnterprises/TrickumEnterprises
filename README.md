- 👋 Hi, I’m Benny Trickum, Cheif Excecutive Officer of Trickum Enterprises LLC 
- 👀 We at Trickum Enterprises are interested and absolutely committed too making a lasting mark on the world.
- 🌱 I’m a Entrepreneur of the highest standard.  I let nothing stand in my way or hold be back.  Lack of information is only a set back in achieving a deadline, never a road block or even worth stumbling over.  Information is just a button away so get that shit, get all you can get!
- 💞️ I’m mostly here for documentation and exposure.  There is nothing I've set my mind to that I haven't achieved or been successful at, (except my marrage, but I consider that fate because there was nothing I could do in that).  Losses dont exist in the short term they are permanent.  A loss is forever like you lost some one to death. Its a defining word and in the short term, traps us into believing something that is not true.  In these terms there is only fate and failure in life and what we make of it between the coming of our existance and the expireing of our fate.  A situation out of our control that we have given everything to that ends in failure especially when there is another desicion making ability (i.e. another person) as a variable becomes fate not failure.  Failure is never absolute unless accepted only fate and loss. Then depending on your beliefe system which is the pinacle point of all of our success, fate then becomes the only absolute becasue loss is only until Imortality where we are reaquainted with our losses also obtaining perfection that we may never lose again.  When you give somthing everything you have and leave nothing out or off and still lose; then there is no fault, it is fate.  At this point becomes a choice, to have serenity and accept that which you can not change or too remain defeated and traped in time.  Living out your life in missouri of defeat to the slippery spirit of language.  This will never be a problem for me and I would love to be able to give others, now, and into the future generations the same true understanding so...--> I am absolutely open to brainstorming and philisophically stimulating conversation anything and everything to make life more interesting and efficient for the generations after us-->
